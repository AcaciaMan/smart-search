# Statistics Feature Test

## How to Test the Statistics Feature

1. **Open VS Code** with the Smart Search extension loaded
2. **Perform a search** using either:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+F` (keyboard shortcut)
   - Command Palette: "Smart Search"
   - Search View Panel (sidebar)

3. **Wait for results** to appear in the Ripgrep Results panel

4. **Click the "ðŸ“Š Statistics" button** in the results header (next to the results count)

5. **Verify the Statistics Panel** opens and displays:
   - **Summary Cards**: Total Results, Files Found, Total Matches
   - **Clickable Statistics Tables**:
     - **Top Folders**: Most frequent directories (click to see matches from that folder)
     - **Top File Extensions**: Most frequent file types (click to see matches with that extension)  
     - **Top File Names**: Most frequent individual file names (click to see matches from that file)
     - **Top File Prefixes**: Sophisticated analysis of file name prefixes including:
       - Dot-separated prefixes (user.service â†’ "user")
       - CamelCase prefixes (getUserData â†’ "get", "getUser") 
       - Underscore/kebab prefixes (user_controller â†’ "user")
       - Common programming patterns (get*, create*, handle*, etc.)
       - Numeric patterns (v1, version2, etc.)
     - **Top File Suffixes**: Advanced analysis of file name suffixes including:
       - Meaningful suffixes (excluding extensions)
       - Programming pattern suffixes (*Controller, *Service, *Helper, etc.)
       - CamelCase suffixes (getUserData â†’ "Data", "UserData")
       - Compound patterns and version suffixes
     - **Recent Modifications**: Files sorted by modification date (click to see matches from that file)

6. **Click on any statistics item** to drill down into filtered results showing only matches for that specific criteria
   - **Recent Modifications**: Files sorted by modification date

## Features Implemented

### Statistics Panel Components

1. **StatisticsPanel Class** (`src/panels/statisticsPanel.ts`)
   - Calculates comprehensive statistics from search results
   - Handles file system operations for modification dates
   - Provides formatted data for the webview

2. **Statistics HTML Template** (`src/webview/statistics.html`)
   - Responsive grid layout
   - VS Code theme-aware styling
   - Interactive progress bars
   - Sortable data displays

4. **Statistics Item Results Panel** (`src/panels/statisticsItemResultsPanel.ts`)
   - Filters original search results based on clicked statistics item
   - Shows filtered results in ripgrep-style format
   - Maintains original search context and highlighting

### Statistics Calculated

- **File Directories**: Shows which folders contain the most matches
- **File Extensions**: Reveals most common file types in results  
- **File Names**: Identifies frequently matched files
- **Name Prefixes**: Multi-layered analysis including dot-separated, camelCase, underscore patterns, and programming conventions
- **Name Suffixes**: Advanced pattern recognition for programming suffixes, compound names, and meaningful word endings
- **Modification Dates**: Recent files with matches (requires file system access)

### UI/UX Features

- **Interactive Statistics**: Click any statistics item to drill down into filtered results
- **Drill-Down Navigation**: Seamlessly move between statistics overview and detailed results
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains original search query and highlighting in filtered views

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Large Result Sets**: Search for common terms like "function" or "import"
2. **Mixed File Types**: Search across JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc.
3. **Deep Directory Structures**: Test folder analysis
4. **Recent Files**: Verify modification date sorting
5. **Empty Results**: Verify graceful handling of no results
6. **Interactive Drill-Down**: Click on various statistics items to test filtering
7. **Panel Navigation**: Test switching between statistics and filtered results panels using VS Code's built-in panel system
8. **Pattern Recognition**: Verify sophisticated prefix/suffix analysis with real codebases

This feature provides valuable insights into search result patterns and helps developers understand their codebase structure better.
