# Protected words for Solr — currently NOT referenced in any analyzer chain.
#
# protwords.txt only takes effect when used with a stemming filter
# (e.g. PorterStemFilterFactory + KeywordMarkerFilterFactory). This schema
# intentionally has NO stemming because code search needs exact tokens.
#
# This file is kept for future use: if stemming is ever added, these words
# will be preserved from modification.
#
# These words will not be stemmed or modified by filters
# Useful for preserving important technical terms

# Programming keywords that should not be stemmed
