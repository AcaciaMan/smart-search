# Multi-Filter Statistics Enhancement

## Overview

The statistics panel has been enhanced to support multi-criteria filtering. Users can now select multiple statistics items across different categories and apply combined filters to search results.

## New Features

### 1. Multi-Selection Interface
- Statistics items are now selectable/deselectable with visual feedback
- Selected items appear with highlighted background
- Visual selection state is maintained until explicitly cleared

### 2. Filter Controls
- **Selected Filters Section**: Shows all currently selected filters as removable tags
- **Clear All Button**: Removes all selected filters at once
- **Search Filtered Results Button**: Applies the selected filters to show filtered results

### 3. Smart Filtering Logic

#### Single Category Filtering
When items from only one category are selected (e.g., multiple folders):
- Results include files matching ANY of the selected items in that category
- Example: Select "src" and "docs" folders → shows results from both folders

#### Multi-Category Filtering  
When items from different categories are selected (e.g., folders AND extensions):
- Results include files that match ALL selected categories
- Within each category, ANY of the selected items can match
- Example: Select "src" folder AND ".ts" extension → shows only TypeScript files in the src folder

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Keyboard Support**: Use Enter/Space to select items, Tab to navigate
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and focus management
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized layout for smaller screens
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected state and filter status

## Technical Implementation

### New Interfaces
```typescript
interface MultipleFilterCriteria {
  filters: FilterCriteria[];
  originalQuery: string;
}
```

### Key Components
- **StatisticsPanel**: Handles multi-filter message routing
- **StatisticsItemResultsPanel**: Enhanced with multi-criteria filtering logic
- **statistics.html**: Updated UI with selection states and filter controls

### Filtering Algorithm
1. Group filters by category type
2. For each search result, check if it matches ALL categories
3. Within each category, result must match AT LEAST ONE filter
4. Return results that satisfy the cross-category AND logic

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Folders
Select "src" and "tests" folders → Shows results from either folder

### Example 2: Multiple Extensions
Select ".ts" and ".js" extensions → Shows results from either file type

### Example 3: Cross-Category
Select "src" folder AND ".ts" extension → Shows only TypeScript files in src folder

### Example 4: Complex Multi-Filter
Select:
- Folders: "src", "lib" 
- Extensions: ".ts", ".js"
- Prefixes: "test", "spec"

Result: Shows TypeScript or JavaScript files in src or lib folders that have test or spec prefixes

## User Interface Flow

1. **Browse Statistics**: View file analysis in categorized tables
2. **Select Items**: Click on items to select/deselect (visual feedback provided)
3. **Review Selection**: Check selected filters in the filter control section
4. **Apply Filters**: Click "Search Filtered Results" to see filtered results
5. **Refine**: Use "Clear All" to start over or remove individual filter tags

## Benefits

- **Precise Filtering**: Combine multiple criteria for targeted results
- **Flexible Selection**: Mix and match across different categories
- **User-Friendly**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive controls
- **Efficient**: Apply multiple filters in a single operation
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
